Joystick is a software that lets you turn your phone into a virtual game controller for your computer. Simply open the software on your computer, scan the QR code with your phone, and start playing games with your friends.

## Key Features:

3. Your phone will become a virtual joystick, allowing you to control games on your computer.
4. Invite friends to scan the QR code and join in on the fun.
